Incels (involuntary celibates), are a sub-culture community of men who build their identity around their perceived inability to form sexual or romantic relationships. To address the dearth of primary data collected from incels, data were collected from 783 people (some of which identified as incels) to several degrees of completion. Questions asked pertained to basic demographics, mating psychology (e.g., perceived mate value and minimum mate preferences), and general mental wellbeing. These data will be used to shed light on various aspects of incel psychology and may not be limited to only one study or publication. The main author for this project is William Costello, MSc, University of Texas Austin, collaborated by Vania Rolon, MA, Brunel University London; Andrew G. Thomas, PhD, Swansea University, and David P. Scmitt, PhD, Brunel University London.
